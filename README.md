# C_basics (Pi Palindrome Detector and Lee Algorithm Maze Solver)

This repository contains two C programs: one for detecting palindromes within the digits of Ï€ (Pi), and another for solving mazes using the Lee Algorithm.

## Pi Palindrome Detector

The Pi Palindrome Detector program reads the digits of Pi from a file, searches for palindromes of increasing length, and calculates the digit distances between them. It can report the findings in a specific format, including median digit distances.

## Lee Algorithm Maze Solver
The Lee Algorithm Maze Solver program reads a maze from an ASCII text file and finds a path from the start ('S') to the target ('T') using the Lee Algorithm. The program dynamically allocates queues and stacks for efficient pathfinding.
